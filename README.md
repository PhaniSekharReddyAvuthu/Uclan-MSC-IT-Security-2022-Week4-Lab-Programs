7. The file (notebook) can be saved and can be used again later. This is how you run python code in google colab.

8. Before you run the lab programs, you need to import the required library called **PyCryptodome** by using the following command in colab

```
!pip install PyCryptodome
```
 9. After you write the above line of code and click run, it should show you the following output

10. Now you are ready to write the lab programs in the colab and execute them.

11. Whenever you want a new block to write the code, just click **+code** located on the left side.

12. If any files need to get generated by the code, they will be created in the folder shown in below diagram. Click on it for the files to be shown.

## Installation Guide for Windows Computers ( only for personal pc's as installation is not allowed in lab ) :


1. First step is to download python and install it. Python can be directly downloaded from the following link https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.0/python-3.11.0-amd64.exe .
2. After downloading the above file, install it and make sure the option **Add python.exe to PATH** is ticked as shown in the below screenshot while installing.

3. Once the installation gets completed, create a folder for storing your python programs anywhere on the system.
4. Open any text editor like notepad or code editor like notepad++ for writing your python code.
5. Write your desired python code and save it in your created folder by naming it as **filename.py** and also make sure to select **all files** while saving if using notepad.

9. Once after you hit enter, the program will get executed. 
  
10. Likewise, you can write your code using editor, save it with .py extension in your working folder and then execute it using command prompt.
