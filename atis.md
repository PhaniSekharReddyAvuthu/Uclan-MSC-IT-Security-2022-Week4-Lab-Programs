## Advanced Topics in It Security Assignment 1 explaination

I have been getting queries from fellow students regarding how to do the assignment and what actually need to be done in the assignment, So i thought of writing it in my words here as it might help all those who are still in a state of understanding. I assume many of us are from the background where there was no proper exposure to reading papers, literature review, doing reasearch, publishing. Even i am from the same background, but trying to understand as much as i can. I am writing my view here as it might help some. ( how to choose a topic is not the intention of this writing )

So our assignment is all about writing a  research paper on a particular topic related to IT security. So what we need to do is, 

1. Selecting a topic which is booming now or trending now or a latest technology or anything that is directly or indirectly related to security. 
2. Then try to read literature (at least 5 to 10 papers ) about the topic. Literature here refers to Published papers, journal papers, books, websites, etc.
3. Try to understand what is being done like what are the problems being faced, what people are trying to solve and what is acheived so far and what are the limitations.
4. Now try to think about what you can add to that research. Propose a solution which can fix problems more accurately than what is available now. The intention of this assignment is just to propose the better solution and support why it is better but not intended for developing the whole thing.
5. The structure is already given in the brief, follow it.
6. Lets see with an example so that we can understand it better.


### Example  - Detecting fraud websites 

Lets assume that our topic is this. So what we are trying to solve here is about how  can we protect ourselves from fraud websites.

lets assume this is the year 2000 instead of 2022 and assume problem arised in 2000

Now, lets assume that a person 'A' proposed a solution in 2001 that we should not browse websites at all as a solution. ( which is unreal )

Later in 2002, lets assume a person 'B' proposed a solution that we need to use common sense when browsing websites, it will solve this problem according to 'B'

Later in 2005, person 'C' researched and proposed a solution that who ever hosts a website need to submit their Identity Proof as a proof while hosting a website. he thinks that if a ID proof is submitted the person wont develop a fraud website.

Later in 2010, a person named 'D' came up and contradicted with 'C' that  taking ID proof will not solve this problem because they can submit fake ID proof. So he says that there should be an algorithm to detect fraud websites.

Later in 2012, a person named 'E' came up with an algorithm to detect fraud website by using the content present on website.

Later in 2019, assume a person named 'F' came up with more better algorithm to detect fraud websie which is 90 percent accurate.

Later in 2021, assume a person named 'G' came up with Machine learning to detect fraud websites. 


Now , for suppose you in 2022  selected this topic **Detecting fraud websites** to do a research, then what you need to first do is read the literature from the past ( A to G ) and see what they did , just write this in your own words as literature review. This is nothing but called as literature review. Then try to think what can you add to this to make the detection algorithm more better. This is what reasearch column of your assignment need to fulfill. You might have your own views to solve a problem.



So, when selecting a topic, make sure you select something you know and something you can improve which can make task easier. 



I tried to write this short writing to help but if still you dont understand what need to be done, try contacting me or suleman


Thanks for reading. ( as i was in hurry, there can be mistakes realted to grammer and spelling )
